I developed and launched the website for Journeys Central West, a unique service offering vintage Kombi experiences. The site features two main attractions: Valarie, an elegant Kombi for weddings and tours, and Stevie, a versatile coffee van that transforms into a mobile bar. Key features include detailed service descriptions, a gallery of past events, and easy contact options. The design emphasizes the charm and nostalgia of these vintage vehicles, providing a seamless user experience.
